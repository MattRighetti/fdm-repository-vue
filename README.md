# FDM Repository Frontend

## About
The main objective of the Flood Damage Models Repository (FDM) is supporting flood damage modellers in the choice of the best available model(s) for the estimation of flood damage, in a specific context, and for a specific problem at stake. In fact, despite several tools are now available for flood damage estimation, no model can be, at present, considered as a standard.
