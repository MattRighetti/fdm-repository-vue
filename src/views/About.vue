        <p>The main objective of the Flood Damage Models Repository (FDM) is to support flood damage modelers in the choice of the best available model(s) for the estimation of flood damage, in a specific context, and for a specific problem at stake. In fact, despite several tools are now available for flood damage estimation, no model can be, at present, considered as a standard.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The choice of the more suitable model(s) to be implemented can be challenging, above all for non-expert users, and may imply significant errors in damage estimates if done without a critical knowledge of models limits and usability. In fact, damage models are developed to be applied at a specific scale, for a specific type of flood and focusing on a specific exposed item, and are characterised by different levels of robustness and reliability. However, not always the development and evaluation of flood damage models go together with detailed information about when and where a certain model should be applied, or even the model does not have an explicit calibration and validation, that would document and demonstrate how the model performs and how accurately.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To cover this gap, the FDM collects and organises information about available flood damage models, according to distinctive features of each model, which support models users in the comprehension of the context of the implementation, as well as of the reliability and robustness of the model, also with respect to its transferability. In doing so, the FDM is more than a database of existing models in literature, but rather an operative tool in the support of flood damage modellers for more reliable damage analysis. In fact, each FDM field has been conceived in order to support and help users in the implementation of the model they choose. For each model, the FDM highlights critical issues and strengths, in order to be applied in a specific context. Accordingly, the FDM represents also an opportunity to increase knowledge gaps on flood damage assessment tools by providing for each available model fundamental key information in order not to lead to an improper use of the model and then significant errors in the flood damage assessment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The FDM can be browsed by a pull-down menu, by which the user can select different filters; starting from the context of application and the type of model that the user needs, the choice of the filters returns in output the model or models that better fit the requirements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The FDM has been originally conceived and designed by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Politecnico di Milano but it has been thought as a participatory effort by the research community. All researchers working in the field of flood risk (as flood damage models developers or users) are encouraged to contribute in and share their experience to reach the common goal of improving flood damage and risk estimates. </p>
